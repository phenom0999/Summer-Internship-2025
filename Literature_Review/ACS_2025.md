## SUMMARY

This survey of 1200+ Australian workers (800 tech, 400 non-tech) reveals technological skills gaps in workforce. It indicates a drop in job-readiness among ICT graduates (1% in 2024 vs 3% in 2023). It highlights the key AI skills to be developed and its barriers. It predicts the technology workforce demand to increase by 2030 and identifies the disconnect between what the technological leaders value vs the advertised requirements for new roles. It also highlights Australia's position in adopting AI, rise in AI-enabled cyberattacks, and the tech skill gaps in public sector.

## KEY FINDINGS
